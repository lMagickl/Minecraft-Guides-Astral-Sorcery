There are a total of 12 different MANTLES and each has its own properties:

* **Armara**
	* Orbs will fly around you and nullify incoming damage. Each orb will disappear for each point of damage and take a little time to reappear.
* **Evorsio**
	* When killing mobs, a percentage of their max health will be dealt as damage to surrounding mobs.
	* When using a pickaxe you will dig out a 5x5 Area regardless of what type of pickaxe you are using.
		* This has some disadvantages. If you mine up an area with a wood tool and there are ores or other materials that wood cannot mine (such as obsidian) then it will be destroyed.
* **Vicio**
	* Will allow Elytra-style flying.
* **Discidia**
	* Will allow you to Reflect damage. This works better with PVP than with mobs.
* **Aevitas**
	* Constant Regeneration effect. Falling from heights or being one-shot will still kill you.
	* You give off an aura similar to a bone meal effect so things will grow around you.
* **Lucerna**
	* Lets you see mobs (passive or aggressive) through objects. These show on screen as a bunch of yellow glowing orbs. Lets you see spawners (these will be red).
* **Bootes**
	* You will generate Flares around you which will attack mobs that attack you.
* **Fornax**
	* Will give you immunity to fire. Being on fire will give you benefits such as Health Gain, but if you stand on STONE while on fire, the stone block will turn into lava. Great for swimming around in the Nether but bad for Mining.
* **Pelotrio**
	* As you chop down trees, mine or damage mobs, little ghost axes, swords and pickaxes will help you. This is random.
* **Mineralis**
	* When holding a block in your hand, you will see a white square at the locations in which that block appears in the world. For example, if you hold redstone ore in your hand, you will be able to see where there is redstone ore.
* **Octans**
	* Allows you to breathe underwater. Will also let you swim faster and will also let you mine underwater with no restrictions.
* **Horologium**
	* Will create a time stop effect on nearby machines and mobs. This has a 30 second cooldown.
