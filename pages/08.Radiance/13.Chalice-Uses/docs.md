Placing the Chalice next to a Lightwell will drain the Lightwell. This will take care of having to empty the Lightwell as soon as it gets full.

These Chalices (filled with liquid Starlight) can also be put around your Infuser. This allows the Infuser to take Liquid Starlight from the Chalice rather then from the holes in the ground, which makes Infusion not use as much Liquid Starlight. You can put these all around the Infuser as long as they are inside the structure:
