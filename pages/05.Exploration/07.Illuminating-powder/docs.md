With a little bit of Starlight, glowstone and aquamarine you can craft Illumination Powder. It is very useful on its own but it's far more useful when used to craft other items. Once crafted you can right-click it on the ground and it will light up the area. Unlike a torch, it does not have a hit box. The only way to put these out is to place a block over them.
