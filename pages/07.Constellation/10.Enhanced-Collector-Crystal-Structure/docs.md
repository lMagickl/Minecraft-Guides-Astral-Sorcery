The final level of Starlight production uses the Enhanced Collector Crystal Structure. To put it into relative terms, the amount of Starlight produced by Celestial Collectors with strong Crystals, let alone an Enhanced Collector, can allow a player to craft with an Iridescent Altar at noontime or in the middle of a thunderstorm. The amount of Starlight produced renders minor bonuses from elevation close to negligible, but if you still want to min-max, then feel free. As for the Enhanced Collector Structure, it allows a Collector Crystal to be somewhat performant throughout the night, even if its Constellation isn’t in the sky, or during the day. When it comes to Astral Sorcery’s Starlight network, it’s a spectrum of things that affect Starlight production, rather than an on/off switch. Night vs day, Rock Crystal vs Celestial, regular vs enhanced, poor stats vs. perfect stats, Constellation in the night sky, elevation level, Starlight concentration, etc.
