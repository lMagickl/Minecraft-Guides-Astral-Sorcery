The Iridescent Altar requires a lot of Starlight and a few materials but is very important when moving on to more of this mod.

This altar will need a new structure around it. This only takes a few blocks around the top of the altar. Once built it will add a few new features around your altar. You will know this is done when a crystal appears above your altar.
