You can boost the effect of the Pedestal by placing down a Collector Crystal and binding it to the Pedestal with the Linking Tool. This will create a ring around the bottom of the Pedestal at night.

>>>>> If you do not see this ring, restart your game.

You will notice beams of light coming off the Crystal. If you place a Lens where the light ends and bind it back to the Pedestal, you can boost the effect. You can do this up to five times. Once completed, you will see the Constellation on the bottom of the Pedestal:

The Collector Crystal does not need to be bound to the same Constellation but it's a good idea. Once you remove the Crystal, the Lenses may not line up when you replace the it and may need to be re-linked.
