You can test if the Starlight Infuser works by placing an Aquamarine Gem into it by right-clicking the Infuser with the Gem and then right-clicking the Infuser with your Resonating Wand. The Starlight Infuser will then give off a few particles and turn the Aquamarine Gem into a Resonating Gem. This process has a chance of using up one of the 12 “pools” of Liquid Starlight, so ensure that these are always filled.

You will need a few of these Resonating Gems to craft other items later on.
