Each Constellation has its own enchants depending on what it's going to be enchanting.

To see the full list [click here](https://ftb.gamepedia.com/index.php?title=Stellar_Refraction_Table#Constellation_Effects).

You can stack three of the same Constellation pr you can do a single Constellation. You will not always get the same enchant, it could be stronger or weaker. You can also get bonus effects such as Phoenix Fire which can save you from death. Other Enchants such as Protection V can also be achieved.
