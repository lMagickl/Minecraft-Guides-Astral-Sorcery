Now if you have selected the wrong “Root” (constellation) or you have selected perks you don't want then you can reset these, resetting these will still keep any perk points you have earnt and let you spend them again. These stars will reset and refund points.

There are 5 stars you can use, using any of these stars will KEEP the attunement you want and remove the others.
