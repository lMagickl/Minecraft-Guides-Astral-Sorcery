In addition to attuning yourself, Rock Crystals can also be attuned. You can repeat the same process you used to attune yourself, but instead of standing in the middle of the Attunement Altar, throw a Rock Crystal in. This will take a bit of time and then will attune that Rock Crystal to the Constellation which you have marked out with Relays.
