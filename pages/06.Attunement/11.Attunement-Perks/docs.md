The Attunement Perks have been given a huge overhaul, these perks work much like Path of Exiles talent system, some perks will give you extra points to spend and others will increase bonus by a percentage while others will give you a straight out boost.

This system does not have  strict path you need to follow but you will need to work your way through the tree to get certain perks. It is very advisable that you have a brief look over all of the perks and plan out your route, you can always change this via Irradiant Stars.
